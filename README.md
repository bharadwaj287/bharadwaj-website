# My visit to United States.
This is my first website.
I recently went to New York, where I explored the Statue of Liberty and Times Square. These two places are considered to be among the most popular in the entire New York.
The Statue of Liberty is a huge, welcoming figure standing tall on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. With her torch raised high, she symbolizes freedom and hope for people coming to America. Visitors can take a ferry to get up close and enjoy amazing views of the city and harbor. She's a favorite spot for photos and is often seen as a symbol of new beginnings. Whether by day or night, her presence is awe-inspiring and always full of meaning.
Visiting Times Square was an unforgettable experience! The massive billboards lit up the whole area, and the energy was contagious. I loved walking through the crowds, exploring shops, and grabbing a quick bite at a nearby caf√©. Street performers and artists made the whole place feel like a show, adding to the excitement. The vibe was incredible, and I couldn't help but feel like I was in the heart of the city!
Thank you for visiting my website!
